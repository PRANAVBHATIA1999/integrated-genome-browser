<h1>
Hello Again - Adding a Glyph</h1>
Now let's flesh this out a bit with the help of a few more GenoViz classes.
<p>Look at the <a href="../tutorial/genoviz/HelloMap.java">source</a>.
<p>
In the first few lines,
we introduce a few methods for setting parameters of the map:
<pre>
map.setMapRange(1, 100);
map.setMapOffset(0, 50);
map.addAxis(10);
</pre>
We set
the horizontal range of the map and the vertical offsets the map will handle.
Range numbers increase from left to right. Offset numbers increase from
top to bottom. We also specify that we want an axis drawn near the top
of the map (offset 10 from the top).

<p>The next thing we do is add a glyph to the map. GenoViz supplies
a number of glyphs you can use. Here we use a StringGlyph so we can present
a message. To use a glyph, the map is configured for a particular type
of glyph. Then a glyph is added at a particular stretch of the map:
<pre>
map.configure(
         "-offset 25 -color black " +                      
         "-glyphtype com.affymetrix.genoviz.glyph.StringGlyph -width 9");
StringGlyph sg = (StringGlyph) map.addItem(45, 54);
sg.setString("Hello Map");
</pre>
The options to map.configure() are explained on the 
<a href="SimpleMap.html">next page</a> of the tutorial. You
could add several glyphs all of the same type to the map in different horizontal
locations without reconfiguring. Some of the glyphs can take other properties.
The StringGlyph is one of these. This is why the glyph is returned by the
addItem method. Here we set a text string for the StringGlyph. A SequenceGlyph
can have a string of residues set.
<p>NeoPanel is a heavyweight panel that overrides update() and paint()
to avoid flicker. It ensures that no background is drawn (except occasionally
in peers in some JVMs). Lightweight components can thus be placed in a
NeoBlankPanel to prevent flickering when lightweights are painting. This
is needed because lightweight painting forces painting of heavyweight (containment)
ancestors.

<p>Here's how it looks running as an Applet.
