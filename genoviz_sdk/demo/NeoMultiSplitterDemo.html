    This demo shows some of the capabilities of NeoMultiSplitter, which
    extends java.awt.Panel. NeoMultiSplitter puts multiple components 
    in a panel where their layout can be dynamically changed by adjusting borders
    between them. This is similar to Swing's JSplitPane. This one, however can layout 
    more than two components. It can also be used with Java 1.0. NeoMultiSplitter
    splits the panel using NeoSplitterBar. A desired size of divider can be set.
    However, this class is still a bit experimental and some of the features might 
    not work right on some environments
