<body>

<p> Here we demonstrate a vertically oriented map.
Both maps below were built with the exact same API calls,
except for different constructors:
</p>
<pre>
  map = new NeoMap(map.HORIZONTAL);
  map = new NeoMap(map.VERTICAL);
</pre>

This demo also illustrates the usage of a hairline glyph,
also called a Shadow glyph.
Zooming along the primary axis will be centered along the point indicated
by the hairline.

<p> <strong>CAVEAT</strong>:
Some of the glyphs included in the GenoViz do not yet display correctly
on vertical maps.
Those descended from DirectedGlyph do.
</p>
