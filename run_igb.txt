REM    Rename this file to "run_igb.bat" before running it
REM    on a windows system.
REM
REM    This file is named with ".txt" to avoid problems with
REM    anti-virus programs that prevent ".bat" files from being
REM    distributed.
REM
REM    This file was written to execute the IGB program.  We cannot
REM    assume responsibility if it has been hijacked by someone else
REM    to run a virus or other malicious program.


REM This is an EXAMPLE of a shell script to run igb from jar files
REM on a Windows system.

REM You may need to edit it for your system.



REM This file assumes you have the 'java' program in your PATH.
REM If not, see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/install-windows.html
REM for instructions on setting the PATH variable.


REM The genoviz.jar and genometry.jar files are stored in different
