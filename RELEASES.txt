Integrated Genome Browser - Versions
-------------------------------------------------------------------

IGB-4.34

  + The "Graph Adjuster" tab is easier to use and has additional functions
  ++ Graph heights may now be adjusted
  ++ Several new heat-maps are available, including transparent ones
  ++ Graphs may now be re-named (right-click on the tier label)
  ++ Graph Thresholding is performed in a separate window (press "Thresholding")
  ++ It is possible to combine multiple graphs in one tier (press "Combine")

  + All IGB file types can be opened with File->Open
  ++ If "merge" is selected, data will be added to the current genome
  ++ If "merge" is *not* selected, a new temporary genome will be created

  + It is now possible to open Affymetrix "CHP" files for "tiling" arrays
  ++ It is *not* possible to open "CHP" files for "expression" arrays

  + You may now access any previously-loaded genome and sequence with the
  ++ controls on the left-hand side of the "Data Access" tab

  + IDs of data from all file types is now indexed so that
  ++ the IDs appear in the "Annotation Browser" tab
  ++ the search-by-ID function works for all data file types
  
  + Multiple items can now be indexed with the same ID
  ++ Searching for an ID will result in all matching items being selected
  ++ Search is no longer case-sensitive
    
  + The DAS/2 data transfer specification continues to evolve (see biodas.org)
  ++ This version of IGB is up-to-date with the current public servers
  ++ Older DAS/2 versions are out-of-date and may no longer be used with IGB

  + The interface for data loading from DAS/2 servers has been improved

  + It is now possible to load graph data via DAS/2 from compatible servers
  
  + The "Bookmark Manager" is now opened with "Bookmarks->Manage Bookmarks"


IGB-4.12
  + Fixed bug that QuickLoad das_servers.txt files were not being read
  + Fixed bug where keyboard shortcut list wasn't kept up-to-date 

IGB-4.10
  + Added the possibility to have multiple QuickLoad servers
  + Now restores your most recent genome and sequence when restarting
  + Updated user's manual
  + Various bugfixes

IGB-4.02
  + Added preliminary support for version 2 of the DAS protocol
  + Implemented a customizer for setting properties of annotation tiers
  + Deprecated most features of the igb_prefs.xml file

IGB-3.62
  + Overhaul of the selection mechanism: 
  ++ dragging selects multiple items; 
  ++ dragging started in Axis selects sequence residues
  + Changed the order that preferences from igb_prefs.xml are applied:
  ++ Exact matches ('annot_type') are tested first, and are case sensitive.
  ++ Regular expressions ('annot_type_regex') are tested next, 
     and are case-sensitive unless the flag '(?i)' is used. 
  ++ In both cases, items later in the xml files override ones listed earlier.
  + More support for reading .bar and .bed files produced by the
    Affymetrix "GTAS" program.
	+ Fixed bug #1219403 where opening the "combine graphs" pop-up was 
    hard to do on Macintosh.
  + Fixed bug #1241228 where sliced view could get out-of-memory errors 
    due to graphs
  + Fixed bug #1143530 involving case-sensitivity in GFF file parsing
  + File-type extensions now treated as case-insensitive.
	+ Added Help->Console where diagnostic and operational data is printed.
	+ Fixed round-off errors in the auto-scroll panel.
  + Added a status bar that reports which items are selected, among other things


IGB-3.58
  + Bug fixes and enhancements for viewing graphs from '.bar' files 
  + Usability enhancements for viewing graphs from '.sin' files.
  + Now accepts content-type "text/xml" for DASGFF xml
  + "Clear" button on the Pattern Search view now clears all the text fields

IGB-3.56
  + Bug fixes and enhancements for viewing graphs from '.sin' files
  
IGB-3.54
  + Improvements to loading data when the "merge" box is not selected.
  
IGB-3.51
  + Added capabilities for parsing '.sin' files in sin format 3,
    including matching IDs to multiple items labeled as "id.0", "id.1", etc.
  + Prelimiary code preparing for future support of the DAS/2 protocol
  + Add group ID's from GFF (GFF version 1) files to the symbol hash
  + Added support for loading data from the HuEx-1_0 GeneChip (TM)


IGB-3.42
  + When making graphs for '.sin' files, can now make separate graphs
    for '+' and '-' strands, and these graphs automatically start
    in the "stair-step" style
  + Added a 'bp1' file format and a EfficientProbesetSymA object
    for efficient representation of probe set data for the 
    HuEx-1_0 GeneChip (TM)

IGB-3.31
  + Adding "Make graphs from scored intervals" preference to general 
    options pane.
  + Bug fixes in SmartGraphGlyph
  + Added ability to "clone" graphs (duplicate them in the display)
  + Added some heatmap coloring options in the Pivot View
  + Changed some of the "Toggle" menu items to use JCheckBoxMenuItem
  + Removed the "Add Graph" menu item.  Graphs are now opened with
    "Open File"
  + Removed the option to set the browser command in Mac OS X, as
    it isn't needed.  Mac's "open" command works best.
  + Added an additional optional format for the Axis Glyph: "ABBREV"
  + Improvements in Edge Matching
  + Stopped adding all the extra temporary sequences from the ".link.psl" 
    alignment files to the list shown in QuickLoad
  + Prelimiary code preparing for future support of the DAS/2 protocol
  +  Changed how score-based graph thresholding is handled.  Now score 
     thresholding can have both a min that score must be >=, 
     and a max that score must be <=.  
  

IGB-3.22
  + Version 3.22 is the initial release of the Integrated Genome Browser 
    via SourceForge.
  + The SorceForge release includes code for the GenoViz SDK, Genometry, 
    and the Integraged Genome Browser (IGB).
  + Earlier versions of the Integrated Genome Browser, including the code
    from Genometry, had been released by Affymetrix, Inc.
    http://www.affymetrix.com/support/developer/tools/affytools.affx
  + Earlier versions of the GenoViz SDK had been released under the name
    "Neomorphic Genome Software Development Kit" (NGSDK) by Neomorphic, Inc.,
    and later as part of the source code for IGB, released by Affymetrix, Inc.
  + Further development will occur through SourceForge.
