<h1>Preferences</h1>
<p>
    The tabs in the Help window control different aspects of the program.  
    In each case, any values you set will remain in effect when you shut down and restart the program.  
    In some cases, the changes will take effect immediately.  
    In other cases, it will be necessary to shut down and restart the program before the changes take effect.

<h2>Import Preferences</h2>
