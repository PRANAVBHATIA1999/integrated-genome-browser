        <h1>Tracks</h1>
        <p>Use this panel to change properties of annotation tracks.  Changes do not require re-start, and settings for most annotation types will be remembered between sessions.</p>
        <h2>Display Name</h2>
        <p>Sets the name to display as the track label.  By default, this is the same as track ID, but you can change the displayed name if you wish.</p>
        <h2>Foreground and Background</h2>
        <p>Sets the foreground and background colors.</p>
        <h2>Name Size</h2>
        <p>Set the font size of track name.</p>
        <h2>Apply to All</h2>
        <p>Apply Background, Foreground, and Name Size to all tracks.</p>
        <h2>Label Field</h2>
        <p>The name of the field to use to construct labels.  For most annotation types you may choose to use 'id' to turn labels on or leave this blank to turn off labels.  Turning labels off reduces the memory required by the program.  Not all annotation types have 'id' fields, so it isn't possible to use 'id' for all types.  Features in some annotation types have additional properties that you may choose to use for a label.  For example, with 'RefSeq' data, you may choose to use 'gene name'.  Check in the 'Selection Info' window to find the names of the properties for items of any type.</p>
        <p>Note that when Connected is true, the label is constructed from the property value of the whole transcript.  When false, the label is constructed from the property values of each individual exon.  Since the individual exons and the whole transcripts may have properties with different names, changing the setting of Connected may affect which labels are shown.</p>
        <h2>Max Depth</h2>
        <p>The maximum rows of annotations to show in tracks that are <em>not</em> collapsed.</p>
        <h2>Show 2 Tracks (+/-)</h2>
        <p>Whether to display annotations in two tracks (+) and (-), or one (+/-).</p>
        <h2>Connected</h2>
        <p>Whether to connect groups of exons into transcripts.  Should be false for data with no intron-exon structure, such as repeats or contigs.  Setting this to false for items that <em>do</em> have intron-exon structure may affect whether labels are displayed.  See below.</p>
        <h2>Collapsed</h2>
        <p>Whether to collapse the track to its minimum height.</p>
        <h2>Auto Refresh</h2>
        <p>If selected, the display will refresh automatically after each change.</p>
        <h2>Refresh Map</h2>
        <p>Redraws the display applying any changes that have been made in the table.</p>
