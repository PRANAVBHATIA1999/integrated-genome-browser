/**
 * This class represents a position inside a block compressed gz file.
 * These files are compressed as separate blocks, and each position
 * contains two parts, the position of the compressed block in the file,
 * and the offset inside the (uncompressed) block. Some calculations need
 * the uncompressed position, but this can only be approximated by using
 * an average compression ration to convert compressed file positions to
 * uncompressed positions.
 * Examples of block compressed gz files are files used with a tabix index,
 * and BAM files.
