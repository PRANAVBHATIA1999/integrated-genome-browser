# WebLinks Module
The Weblinks module is small but useful IGB plugin which makes it easy for user's to tap into external resources to get additional information about annotations or tracks in the Data Display Area. 
It accomplishes this by allowing regular expression patterns to be applied to the annotation or track currently selected to dynamically populate a context menu for a given selection.
