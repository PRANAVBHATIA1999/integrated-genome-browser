  <p>
  This package contains implementations of interfaces,
  and extensions of classes from the Genometry package
  for use in IGB.
  </p>
  <p>
  The interfaces classes in com.affymetrix.genometry should be kept simple.
  When special extensions are needed for IGB, those classes belong here.
  These classes also often emphasize efficient memory use.
