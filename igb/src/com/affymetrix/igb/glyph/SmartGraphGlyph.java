/**
 *  A smarter graph glyph.
 *  It:
 * <ol>
 * <li> improves efficiency of drawing zoomed-out large graphs (via max once-per-pixel drawing)
 * <li> improves efficiency of drawing zoomed-in large graphs (via binary search for draw end-points)
 * <li> allows for summarizing min, max, and average separately for zoomed-out graphs
 * <li> allows for on-the-fly thresholding and "glyphification" of regions that pass threshold
 * </ol>
 *
 *  Also, now trying to further improve efficiency for zoomed-out large graphs via data structure
 *      enhancements.
 *  And, working on drawing y-axis....
 *
 *  ONLY MEANT FOR GRAPHS ON HORIZONTAL MAPS
