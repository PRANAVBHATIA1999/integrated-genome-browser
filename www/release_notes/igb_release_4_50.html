<h1>IGB 4.50 release notes.</h1>

IGB 4.50 adds new capabilities for file parsing and display manipulation.<br><br>

A few new features were added in version 4.48.<br><br>

Highlights:
<ul>

<li><b>Version 4.50</b>  
<ul>

<li>There is better support for sharing files between IGB and the 
UCSC Genome Browser.<br><br>
Since many users of IGB are familiar with the 
<a href="foo">UCSC Genome Browser</a> and have created files specifically
for use with it, we have made some changes that allow the two programs
to work together more easily.
<ul>
  <li>Added support for reading the <a href="??">Wiggle Graph Format</a>
  <li>Parsing of <a href="??">Track Lines</a> is consistent with
      the UCSC browser for formats "BED", "GFF", "PSL" and "WIG".
      IGB makes use of these properties <i>useScore</i>, 
      <i>url</i>, <i>description</i> and <i>visibility</i>.
  <li>IGB also support parsings of Track Lines for "GFF3" format, though
      the UCSC browser does not yet support this format.
      (Track line must begin with "##track".)
  <li>The range coordinate box in IGB now allows input of coordinates in
      the same format used by UCSC, e.g. "chr1:1,000,000-2,000,000", so
      that you may easily copy and paste coordinates from one program 
      to the other.
  <li>Allows coloring exons, and other features, based on their score.
      (Works with "BED", "GFF" and "GFF3" files.)
      This can be turned on and off from a track line, or from a menu item.
      The colors are interpolated from the given foreground and background colors.
</ul>
<br><br>
</li>


<li>Added a small display to always show the current position of the hairline.
(Something similar was possible in earlier versions with "Toggle Hairline Label",
but that label could cover-up some annotations.)<br><br>
</li>

<li>Something with a picture.
<br><br><img src="images/xxx.gif">
<br>Figure: XXX.<br><br>
</li>


<li>Added support for parsing "CHP" files for
expression chips.  The genomic locations of probesets
are not included in these files, but IGB will automatically load
that information as needed from a DAS-based web server.<br><br>
</li>


<li>The buttons for performing arithmetic operations on two graphs
have been fixed.  (In version 4.48, they all performed subtraction, instead
of the full four operations.)<br><br>
</li>

<li>The DAS/2 client now complies completely with the final
DAS/2 specification for feature data retrieval.  (This version
of the DAS/2 specification is the final "frozen" version.)<br><br>
</li>

<li>Now allowing configuration of multiple web links from
each feature type.<br><br></li>

<li>You can now choose to show or hide the "+" and "-" strands of data.
<br><br></li>


<li>You can now load a FASTA formatted file that contains sequence
data for multiple chromosomes (or other sequences).  FASTA format
is recommended only for small genomes.<br><br></li>

<li>When "BAR" format files contain datat from multiple genomes,
the data from all those genomes will be read and made available
through the "Data Access" tab.<br><br></li>


</ul>
