ProtAnnot is a protein annotation viewer implemented in Java that displays protein 
annotations in the context of the genomic sequence, making it easy to see how alternative 
mRNA structures affect the various protein products encoded at a locus. ProtAnnot is 
developed in the Loraine Lab, part of the Bioinformatics and Genomics Department 
at University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
