The 23andMe SNP Converter converts the 23andMe SNP genotype results to
a BED-format file you can open and visualize in IGB. 

Installing the 23andMe SNP Converter adds a new menu item to the 
IGB *Tools* menu.

To run the converter:

* Select *Tools > 23andMe SNP Converter* to open the converter window
* In the converter window, select an unzipped 23andMe data file 
* Select a destination folder where you'd like to save the converted file
* Enter a name for the output file. The file extension will be added.
* *Optional* - Select convert to latest human genome build.

When we first developed the 23andMe SNP Converter, data files from 23andMe used
the 2008 (build 37) version of the human reference genome. If you would like 
the Converter to create a file you can view using the more recent, 2013 (hg38)
reference human genome, select *Use reference to upgrade*. Note this will add
extra time to the process.
