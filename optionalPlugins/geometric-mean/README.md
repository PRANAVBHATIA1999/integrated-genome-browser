The Geometric Mean Graph Operator provides a graph operator for creating a geometric mean graph for multiple graphs.

To run the operator:

* Select two or more graph track labels by holding the shift key and selecting the appropriate track labels.  
* Go to the Operations section under the Graph tab.  
* Select the Geometric Mean option in the Multi-Graph dropdown menu and select Go.  A new graph track will be added with the geometric mean of the selected graphs.
